        <strong>Welcome!</strong>
        <br />
        Thank you for visiting my website and for your time and interest.
        <br />
        If there are any questions about the information please do get in touch.

        <br />
        I define the visual DNA of brands, cities and organisations.
        <br />
        My observations, imaginative stories and discovery tours for companies
        and municipalities stimulate new thinking for innovative behaviour.
        <br />
        I share my eyes with international A-brand suppliers, companies in
        fashion, retail, financial services, real estate development and
        marketing communication.
        <br />
        My work is often described as eye-opening.
        <br />
        Municipalities invite me to visualise and describe the present status
        and the potential of their cities.
        <br />
        While taking people on my discovery tours throughout the world, I teach
        what daily insights can offer.
        <br />
        Inspiring trips offer the (re-) discovery of beauty and trace the
        challenges of innovation and new thinking.
        <br />
        Always with a catching curiosity for why people do what they do?
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamentals of my approach are based on streetology.
        <br />
        There is no strategy without streetology.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Understanding &nbsp;the difference between:</strong>
        <br />
        Looking and really seeing.
        <br />
        The difference between just hearing and really internalising what you
        hear.
        <br />
        Getting in touch and connect.
        <br />
        In order to create relevant, meaningful and challenging insights and
        perspectives for the coming years.
