      text: "Successes are not achieved, even though they are often claimed, by masters in finance. A success is an opportunity into a reality. And there are opportunities everywhere: waiting to be realised. Look carefully, and <u>with new eyes</u>, that's often when you'll be able to make them work for you.",

      text: "	These days people are wired and networked; what they haven't yet discoverd for themselves, they can learn form others. Essential knowledge is reached by conversations and discussion. All the demands made on you to be alert and sharp make it even more crucial that you see clearly, say what you mean, and become who you are. There's nothing more wonderful than evolution.",

      text: "The trend of providing \"bread and circus\" as content, presented as an \"experience\", persists. The product and the film. The product and the musical. The performance and the master class. The theme of an event is increasingly a meaningful and ideally unforgettable encounter. But the added value of 'content' is only achieved once the 'delivery' is experienced.",

      text: "My open eyes have served me well all these years. I look at everything around me, of course, but especially at people, their position, attitudes and behaviours in their world. I make contact with them with my eyes, and it's without doubt my post pleasant discovery and one I hold dear. My wish is for everyone to open their eyes this way.",

      key: 7,
      header: "7. Get close",
      text: "Marketing can't be done from a distance, nor purely on the basis of rationality. Marketing takes place on your doorstep, on the street, at markets and other gathering places. Only there will you run into people who can see, feel, taste, consider and buy your product or service. Get close! Look in their eyes, look at their facial expressions, their body language. Listen to what they're saying and what they're not. Then take it from there.",

      text: "Superficiality is not an option. Quality is the measure, with all it implies, of knowledge, skill, inspiration, motivation and healthy pride. From these deepest sources come individuality, strength, and self-confidence. We can't do it any other way.",

      header: "9. Give your all",
      text: "Sometimes - quite often, actually - it's all about giving everything to the job at hand: our complete self-confidence, energy and optimism. When an organisation creates a climate of trust and confidence, that kind of 'esprit de corps' and teamwork comes from the heart and flourishes.",

      header: "10. Ask the right questions",
      text: "The simplest questions are often the most important: who, what, why, when, how do you feel, are you satisfied and would you do it again if you had the chance? People will eagerly respond to others who are sincerely interested. Digging for treasure can be that easy.",

    {
      key: 11,
      header: "11. True colours",
      text: "We are bombarded by marketing on every conrner, turning colourful streets into dull thoroughfares. What realy matters to the success of a brand is a marketing strategy and messages that are solid through their diversity, consistency and authenticity.",

      key: 13,
      header: "13. What is good, and what feels good",
      text: "Business and institutions should work at convincing their clients that their feelings can be trusted. When something feels right, it usually is, and there's nothinh better than that. Yes, that first 'gut' connection and response is often 'for always'.",

      key: 15,
      header: "15. Embrace the details",
      text: "The bigger picture consists of many points and lines. Without the details, you may as well forget the larger picture. It's ironic beacause the lower people sit in the organisation, the more important the details of what they do and how they do it. It is here and nowhere else that the reputation of your organisation, product or trademark is determined.",

      header: "20. Trust worthy",
      text: "Beware of fads that are like balloons: all surface, no substance, and ready to go up in the air. Restoring trust between marketeers and their target groups is a matter of attitude, actions and a sincere interest.",
